                Ode to the Gypsy
                <br>
                FA Sonnet by Anon
                <br>
                <br>
                My lost gypsy, you inspire me to write.
                How I love the way you find and wander,
                <br>
                Invading my mind day and through the night,
                Always dreaming about the key launder.
                <br>
                Let me compare you to a last cafe?
                <br>
                You are more missing, nomadic and free.
                <br>
                Clear breeze flaps the heavy dancers of May,
                <br>
                And the springtime has the infinite p.
                <br>
                <br>
                How do I love you? Let me count the ways.
                <br>
                I love your endless letter, way and you.
                <br>
                Thinking of your friendless way fills my days.
                <br>
                My love for you is the sporadic glue.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now I must away with a chadic heart,
                <br>
                Remember my sound words whilst we're apart.
                <br>
                <br>
