                Dying, I’ll not say: ‘I was’.
                <br>
                No regrets, I’ll not cast blame.
                <br>
                There are greater things in this world
                <br>
                Than love’s storm, and passion’s game.
                <br>
                But you – wing-beat against my chest,
                <br>
                Fresh, guilty cause of my inspiration –
                <br>
                You I command to: – Be!
                <br>
                My obedience – knows no evasion.
